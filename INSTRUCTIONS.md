# DevOps Interview Challenge

Welcome to the practical DevOps interview! Your task is to fix a broken to-do list application.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mrinallobo/devops-challenge.git`
2. Fix all issues until the application runs and all unit tests pass.
3. Push your changes to a new branch named `<your-name>-fix` (e.g., `john-doe-fix`).
4. Submit the branch URL or create a pull request to `main`.

## Goals
- Make the Docker container build and run successfully.
- Fix the GitHub Actions pipeline.
- Ensure the app works (frontend loads, tasks can be added/viewed).
- Pass all unit tests in `tests/test_app.py`.

## Tips
- Use `docker build` and `docker run` to test locally.
- Check GitHub Actions logs for CI failures.
- Run tests with `python -m unittest discover` inside the container.

Good luck!
